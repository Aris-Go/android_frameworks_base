      "message": "This is likely to be a significant (and noticeable) performance cost, so I\u0027m not sure it will be acceptable. \n\nI haven\u0027t read the full series of changes, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s necessarily \"poor API\" to leave out type checking for these cases, as equivalent Java API (e.g serialization, and other corner cases involving generics) have a similar set of issues. If anything, it\u0027s perhaps proof that type erasure causes tons of problems but that\u0027s already well known.",
