      "message": "\u003e  I think you might mean that UID_SELF is only used from the system uid (is it?), \n\nRight. I always consider UID_SELF a misnomer and it really should be UID_KEYCHAIN. But I\u0027m not intimately familiar with other places where UID_SELF gets used/exposed (I see KeyGenParameterSpec.getUid() returns this and in this case \"caller itself\" could be the right definition) so this could be wrong.",

The uid is not explicitly set to system but rather is implicit from the caller into Keystore.\n\nSo, just documenting that `UID_SELF` corresponds to `NAMESPACE_APPLICATION` seems appropriate for now.\n\nWe should convert all users of `UID_SELF` to use `NAMESPACE_APPLICATION` directly (or nothing, since it is the default namespace) and document which uid they are expecting the keys to be stored under.  I think that\u0027s beyond the scope of this topic though.  This topic is just intended to finish the removal of the obsolete class `android.security.KeyStore`.",
