We don\u0027t want to allow a NetworkAgent to do something like TRANSPORT_TEST|TRANSPORT_WIFI and have NetworkRequests for TRANSPORT_WIFI match that agent, do we?\n\nAlso: for now, should we disallow setting other things that may not be necessary, such as signalStrength, UIDs and so on? In fact, should we start off with something paranoid such as:\n\n    // Ensures that this object only has the fields that are currently used in tests.\n    final int caps \u003d mNetworkCapabilities;\n    final NetworkSpecifier specifier \u003d mNetworkSpecifier;\n    clear();\n    mTransportTypes \u003d TRANSPORT_TEST;\n    mNetworkCapabilities \u003d caps \u0026 TEST_NETWORKS_ALLOWED_CAPABILITIES;\n    mNetworkSpecifier \u003d specifier;\n\n?",
