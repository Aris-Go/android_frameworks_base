In fact I was about to recommend making a defensive copy of this until I understood it had to be the same.\n\nThere are multiple ways to make this principled. You could make the class static, pass a ref to NetworkStatsService, and add methods to write to this. Better, you could have an interface implemented by NetworkStatsService to do this.\n\nIn this case though I just suggest you simply don\u0027t have a member, don\u0027t make the class static, and simply reference the parent mSubtypes directly, seeing how you must write to it (and it\u0027s final anyway).",

Do remember that the map will slot by hashCode() and equals(), and the template is something that matches. If you want two separate last states for these two use cases, just have two different members I think. If you do this because you plan to extend it to a number of subscriptions, maybe an array of pairs or something is more suited. Or you could roll out your own identity map like I said we want in b/148006299 if that\u0027s what you want. Or if what you really need is just the subtype for a given subscription, a SparseArray\u003cInteger\u003e, or even an int[] (assuming subscription IDs have to start at 0 or 1 and be consecutive, which I\u0027m not sure of).\n\nBut as is, I don\u0027t understand where you\u0027re coming from with this.",
