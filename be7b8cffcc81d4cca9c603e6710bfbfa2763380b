      "message": "Looks like this was incorrect before: the function is called arpRequestBroadcast, but we were actually making an ARP *reply*. It\u0027s good that we\u0027re fixing this.\n\nHowever, it does mean that we are no longer testing something that we were testing before. Previously, we were testing that when the device receives a broadcast ARP reply with tip !\u003d 0.0.0.0 it accepts it. Should we continue to test for this? Does it make sense? Maciej, any thoughts?",
