      "message": "documentation is very thin here -- I\u0027m struggling to find any, even groping around in the android/build  tree didn\u0027t get yield a \"this is how the attribute maps to linker options\".\n\nSo there\u0027s a bunch of guesswork from here down.\n\nI\u0027m guessing that the 0 in \"lto_O0\" means we do no link time optimization; that fits with the bug description talking about saving build time by avoiding the LTO step. The bug acknowledges that this has a performance impact on the generated code. The -2 vote from the performance reviewbot implies that the performance difference is significant enough to trip its thresholds.\n\nIs the breakage solely \"longer build time\"? or does the build (eventually) fail?",
