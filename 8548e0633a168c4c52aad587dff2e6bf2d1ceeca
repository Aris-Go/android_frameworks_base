      "message": "Architecturally, this lib could be in many places.\n\nThe reason we decided to put it under the NetworkStack directory is to give us a maximum of control on this, as well as minimizing the number of cases where we\u0027ll have to use topics. Framework test code can depend on this and should continue to be able to depend on this when the mainline modules move to a separate gerrit project. Initially as more of our code is in frameworks/base this may lead to more topics, but we want to move as much stuff to the network stack as we can going forward anyway.",

      "message": "Some email a while back mentions that mockito-target-extended requires JNI libs libdexmakerjvmtiagent and libstaticjvmtiagent, maybe they should be added here ? Not sure if having JNI libs in this shared lib could create issues (probably fine as long as it compiles and everything passes ?)\nWe have some tests (FrameworksNetTests in particular) that don\u0027t use extended mockito, so this change may change some test behavior as final stuff that was not mocked will now be mocked. Not a problem if all passes though, but I don\u0027t know which lib will end up being used in the end, since FrameworksNetTests still includes mockito-target-minus-junit4.",
