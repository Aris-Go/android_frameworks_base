      "message": "Won\u0027t we throw in their face if they try to register without those permissions ? I do see the consistency problem with the case where an app stops satisfying the requirements, but I think it\u0027s easier to understand for developers than to let them register and never do anything for them, and that\u0027s probably more important in this case.\nI guess you can add that any app that stops satisfying the requirements after it registered will stop seeing the callbacks.",
