      "message": "This was intentional due to privacy implications. User0 permissions are not surfaced to the foreground user, hence enabling location access would end up resulting in (a) apps having location without user consent (b) users having no awareness of this data being collected (c) users having no control to revoke this access. Supporting this correctly would require privacy settings and permissions changes on Android that are not trivial.",
