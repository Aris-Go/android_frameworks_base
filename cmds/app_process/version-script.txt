# Symbols exported from the executable in .dynsym interpose symbols in every
# linker namespace, including an app's classloader namespace. Provide this
# empty version script to prevent unwanted interposition.
#
# By default, the static linker doesn't export most of an executable's symbols,
# but it will export a symbol that appears to override a symbol in a needed DSO.
# This commonly happens with C++ vaguely-linked entities, such as template
# functions or type_info variables. Hence, a version script is needed even for
# an executable.
