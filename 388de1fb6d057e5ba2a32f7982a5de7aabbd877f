I don\u0027t think it matters, but you can only call putIfAbsent after testing if the object is not already there or just using computeIfAbsent :\n\n  if (null !\u003d sCallbacks.computeIfAbsent(callback, (k) -\u003e new Binder(callback, k))) throw();\n  try { register }\n\n...in which case the Binder object only gets thrown away in the losing thread of a race condition where 2 threads try to do this at the same time. This is not very costly and it\u0027s a very rare event, so it\u0027s likely it\u0027s a lot cheaper than to lock always.",
