This is especially important when doing failed roaming attempts, where we don\u0027t want to prematurely save stale data. In which case we don\u0027t want to save this here, but wait for the NUD check.\n\nI suggest this part would have to be addressed in the followup change that actually saves to the store. But for the time being I replaced this call with a comment.",
