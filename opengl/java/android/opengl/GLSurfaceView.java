/**
 * An implementation of SurfaceView that uses the dedicated surface for displaying OpenGL rendering.
 * <p>
 * A GLSurfaceView provides the following features:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Manages a surface, which is a special piece of memory that can be composited into the Android view system.
 * <li>Manages an EGL display, which enables OpenGL to render into a surface.
 * <li>Accepts a user-provided Renderer object that does the actual rendering.
 * <li>Renders on a dedicated thread to decouple rendering performance from the UI thread.
 * <li>Supports both on-demand and continuous rendering.
 * <li>Optionally wraps, traces, and/or error-checks the renderer's OpenGL calls.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h3>Using GLSurfaceView</h3>
 * <p>
 * Typically you use GLSurfaceView by subclassing it and overriding one or more of the View system input event methods.
 * If your application does not need to override event methods then GLSurfaceView can be used as-is. For the most part
 * GLSurfaceView behavior is customized by calling "set" methods rather than by subclassing. For example, unlike a
 * regular View, drawing is delegated to a separate Renderer object which is registered with the GLSurfaceView using the
 * {@link #setRenderer(Renderer)} call.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Initializing GLSurfaceView</h3>
 * All you have to do to initialize a GLSurfaceView is call {@link #setRenderer(Renderer)}. However, if desired, you can
 * modify the default behavior of GLSurfaceView by calling one or more of these methods before calling setRenderer:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #setDebugFlags(int)}
 * <li>{@link #setEGLConfigChooser(boolean)}
 * <li>{@link #setEGLConfigChooser(EGLConfigChooser)}
 * <li>{@link #setEGLConfigChooser(int, int, int, int, int, int)}
 * <li>{@link #setGLWrapper(GLWrapper)}
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <h4>Choosing an EGL Configuration</h4>
 * A given Android device may support multiple possible types of drawing surfaces. The available surfaces may differ in
 * how may channels of data are present, as well as how many bits are allocated to each channel. Therefore, the first
 * thing GLSurfaceView has to do when starting to render is choose what type of surface to use.
 * <p>
 * By default GLSurfaceView chooses an available surface that's closest to a 16-bit R5G6B5 surface with a 16-bit depth
 * buffer and no stencil. If you would prefer a different surface (for example, if you do not need a depth buffer) you
 * can override the default behavior by calling one of the setEGLConfigChooser methods.
 * <p>
 * <h4>Debug Behavior</h4>
 * You can optionally modify the behavior of GLSurfaceView by calling one or more of the debugging methods
 * {@link #setDebugFlags(int)}, and {@link #setGLWrapper}. These methods may be called before and/or after setRenderer,
 * but typically they are called before setRenderer so that they take effect immediately.
 * <p>
 * <h4>Setting a Renderer</h4>
 * Finally, you must call {@link #setRenderer} to register a {@link Renderer}. The renderer is responsible for doing the
 * actual OpenGL rendering.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Rendering Mode</h3>
 * Once the renderer is set, you can control whether the renderer draws continuously or on-demand by calling
 * {@link #setRenderMode}. The default is continuous rendering.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Activity Life-cycle</h3>
 * A GLSurfaceView must be notified when the activity is paused and resumed. GLSurfaceView clients are required to call
 * {@link #onPause()} when the activity pauses and {@link #onResume()} when the activity resumes. These calls allow
 * GLSurfaceView to pause and resume the rendering thread, and also allow GLSurfaceView to release and recreate the
 * OpenGL display.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Handling events</h3>
 * <p>
 * To handle an event you will typically subclass GLSurfaceView and override the appropriate method, just as you would
 * with any other View. However, when handling the event, you may need to communicate with the Renderer object that's
 * running in the rendering thread. You can do this using any standard Java cross-thread communication mechanism. In
 * addition, one relatively easy way to communicate with your renderer is to call {@link #queueEvent(Runnable)}. For
 * example:
 * 
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * class MyGLSurfaceView extends GLSurfaceView {
 *     private MyRenderer mMyRenderer;
 * 
 *     public void start() {
 *         mMyRenderer = ...;
 *         setRenderer(mMyRenderer);
 *     }
 * 
 *     public boolean onKeyDown(int keyCode, KeyEvent event) {
 *         if (keyCode == KeyEvent.KEYCODE_DPAD_CENTER) {
 *             queueEvent(new Runnable() {
 *                 // This method will be called on the rendering
 *                 // thread:
 *                 public void run() {
 *                     mMyRenderer.handleDpadCenter();
 *                 }
 *             });
 *             return true;
 *         }
 *         return super.onKeyDown(keyCode, event);
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
