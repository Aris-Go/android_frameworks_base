      "message": "This is going to apply whatever policies are configured to all regular third party apps as well as system apps.  We don\u0027t want this -- third party applications must all be treated equally.\n\nI\u0027d suggest making your SELinuxMMAC class keep track of a single policy that applies to all third party apps.  If this package is not a system package, just always use that.  Otherwise use the definitions here to assign the policy.  Note that you will need to move this assign to a little later in the function, to after we have determined if this is an update to a system apk (system updated system apks should also get the same policy as when they are actually on the system image).",
