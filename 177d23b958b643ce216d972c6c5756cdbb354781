Can the existing types of settings accommodate your usage?\n\nOn the other hand, does it mean that App A can see App B\u0027s setting as long as App A has READ_PACKAGE_SETTINGS permission? That means App A can know that App B is installed, which can violate the package visibility restriction.",

      "message": "The main use case here is Notification Settings. Those are part of the device level settings, but should be set per package. In theory, one can use the system settings for this and create an abstraction on top of this to manage the keys per package. But that has the potential of duplicating this logic over and over again for other settings that are app specific, but on a device level.\nAs for the second question - this permission is a system permission. So only system apps can access it, not just any 3rd party app.",

I see that you are already doing some cleaning up when a package is installed. Why is there still a need to do pruning during boot? Is it for system packages removed during OTA?",
