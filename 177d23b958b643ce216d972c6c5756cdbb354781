Can the existing types of settings accommodate your usage?\n\nOn the other hand, does it mean that App A can see App B\u0027s setting as long as App A has READ_PACKAGE_SETTINGS permission? That means App A can know that App B is installed, which can violate the package visibility restriction.",

I see that you are already doing some cleaning up when a package is installed. Why is there still a need to do pruning during boot? Is it for system packages removed during OTA?",
