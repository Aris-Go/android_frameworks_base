<p>Android graphics are powered by a custom 2D graphics library and OpenGL ES 1.0
for 3D graphics.</p>

<h2>2D Graphics</h2>
<p>Android offers a custom 2D graphics library for drawing shapes and images.</p>
<p>The {@link android.graphics} and {@link android.graphics.drawable} 
packages are where you'll find the classes used for drawing in two-dimensions.
For common drawing tasks, though, the {@link android.graphics.drawable} package 
is where you'll find what you need.</p>
<p>For an introduction to drawing shapes and images, read the 
<a href="2d-graphics.html">2D Graphics</a> document.</p>


<h2>3D with OpenGL</h2>
<p>High performance 3D graphic utilities are provided on Android with the OpenGL ES API.
You'll find the OpenGL APIs in the {@link android.opengl} package.
