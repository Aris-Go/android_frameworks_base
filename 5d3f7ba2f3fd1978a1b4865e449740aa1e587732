      "message": "This is wrong.\n\nSuppose the window we just filled was the last window.  In this case, the window might only contain a few rows because there are none left.  So we will end up assuming that the capacity of the window is much smaller than it truly is.\n\nPlease understand that the capacity is only an optimization.  It is not needed for correctness.  Under ideal conditions all of the rows should fit within one window anyhow.  If the windows are getting too full then the schema or query should probably be redesigned.",

      "message": "You are right for the situation.\r\nBut basically capacity is for locality to enhance performance, and if a row size is fluctuating and capacity is fixed as the first value, cursor window could hold more old rows other than new rows. Then it could query more often for new rows and lower performance.\r\nAnd because the defect is in Native Contacts Application,\r\nif we try to change schema, it would be a bigger job.\r\n(There is a blob field for photo in Contacts. A row size could be fluctuating by the field.)\r\nPlease review this again.",
