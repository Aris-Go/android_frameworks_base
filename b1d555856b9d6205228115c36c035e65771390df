      "message": "Hi, this is another solution for backdrop-filters in View System.\n\nA `BackdropFilterDrawable` is added outside the target `RenderNodeDrawable`. So when the target View or RenderNode has an off-screen layer, the previous `Canvas.saveLayer` solution doesn\u0027t work but this solution does.\n\nBut when some of the parent Views have extra layers, the `BackdropFilterDrawable` can only get snapshot of the nearest layer. I find it is very difficult to get a complete backdrop content in this case.",
