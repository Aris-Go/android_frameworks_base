      "message": "Yes I wondered that myself. I think in most cases the current message is not adding anything, so we want to keep only those that do. So here is what I did :\n• Add an assertThrows that takes a message\n• Use it when the message was useful\n• Remove the message when it is redundant\n\nNow this specific message here is a special case, because it looks like the return value is useful in debugging, but\n• I don\u0027t think it provides a lot of value. If this ever start failing (which I deem very unlikely), it\u0027s trivial to change the test to display it.\n• It\u0027s super annoying to do with the new style because the message depends on the return value of the block.\n\nIt\u0027s not infeasible but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s worth the hassle.",
