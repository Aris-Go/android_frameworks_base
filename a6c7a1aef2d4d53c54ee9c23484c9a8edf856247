      "message": "I\u0027m not 100% sure they\u0027re identical, but this change makes the tests pass and it makes sense. My understanding is that Soong would generate a jar of the same name as the module, which was not the case for make.\n\nI did use your jar diff tool on some outputs I found from the make and Soong runs of the test, and the DynamicCodeLoggerIntegrationTests.jar was a superset of what was contained in javalib.jar; though it only contained a few elements that javalib did not. That said I don\u0027t know for sure that I compared the right jars. There were a number of them.",
