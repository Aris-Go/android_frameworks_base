      "message": "Nit: often when trying to enforce that something didn\u0027t happen it\u0027s beneficial to use a Mock object, where you can record, replay, and verify expectations.\n\nHaving an explicit counter in a home-grown object works too but it does require that you remember to update any future method calls to update totalOperations.\n\nThat said, given that your TestConnectivityManager is already more sophisticated than a simple mock it, using a mock might not be useful at all.",
