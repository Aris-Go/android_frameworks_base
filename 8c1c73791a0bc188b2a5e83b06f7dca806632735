      "message": "Evan, do you know why we used `plugged` instead of `charging` to determine when to show the lightning bolt on the battery icon? I figure there\u0027s a good reason, but this code has existed long before I joined the team.",

Assuming that `charged` and `plugged` mean what we expect them to (actually charging vs just having a wired connection that may not be charging) then this seems reasonable to me.",
