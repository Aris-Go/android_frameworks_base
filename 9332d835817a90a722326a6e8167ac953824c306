      "message": "The objective here is to \"always\" redact location info. If we don\u0027t do that, then registrants will incur a \"location lookup\", which means that anybody registered for PCC is going to get blamed for a huge number of \"location\" accesses they didn\u0027t need/want. Since there is no public-facing use-case that requires the physical cell identity, we think it\u0027s better to simply not provide location-sensitive info AND to not do the permission check in S. Once Sharkey\u0027s API for \"renouncing\" permissions is ready in T, then we can expose the PCI in T.\n\n@Rambo, Jack\u0027s comment makes it obvious for me that we should have some comment/explanation of why it is this way for now. :-) @Jack, if you have concern about the idea, then let\u0027s chat. I believe what Rambo has here is aligned with what was agreed with Robert and Tyler, but we can double-check that to make sure.",
