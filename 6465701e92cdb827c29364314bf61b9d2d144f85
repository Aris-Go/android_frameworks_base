We actually have an internal patch that fixed this exact issue in the same way you fixed (ag/24958509 - for other reviewers that may need to look at it), next release will contain the fix, in the meantime you can use your patch locally (unless there is a strong reason that we CP the patch before the next release?) but I don\u0027t think we need to land it in AOSP as it would conflict then conflict with our fix.",
