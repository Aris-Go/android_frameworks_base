      "message": "As you said, \"0000:00:01\" is invalid data. But I haven\u0027t seen such a timestamp.\n\nSome camera returns all zero when it has no data to set. But \"0000:00:01\" hardly happens. Strictly speaking, there are many invalid timestamps, e.g. \"1997:00:00\", \"9999:13:02\" etc. I think current implementation is reasonable to handle actual problem.\n\nOn the other hand, I think current commit title is confusing. Let me change the title (and commit message again)",
