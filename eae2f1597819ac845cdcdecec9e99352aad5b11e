      "message": "Originally I did it that way and had to change it later, so I came back to have this design from the start.\nNote that it\u0027s required that this object accumulates the changes, so I wrote a \u0027merge\u0027 function when I returning a new object everytime. This function had to account for more and more things going forward until it stopped being sustainable. I thought it was better not to put reviewers through this shift in paradigm twice.\n\nNote that I have a comment about this in l.6362. This is temporary though it will persist for a fairly long time throughout the refactoring.",
