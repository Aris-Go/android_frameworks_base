      "message": "Actually, thinking about this some more, I guess it\u0027s possible that such a bug could have gone unfixed for so long. The impact is pretty low: basically, a debuggable app that uses the LocalSocket API and gets an error reading from a socket will crash. It\u0027s possible that such a bug went unreported or unfixed.\n\nMaybe merge this now and upload a cherry-pick to tm-dev but don\u0027t merge it until tomorrow? In the meantime, if Elliott points out a problem or suggests a better fix we can revert in AOSP.",
