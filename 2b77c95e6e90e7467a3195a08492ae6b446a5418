While XYZ for red, green and blue in icc profile are correct, the white point is not correct, i.e. is not D50! Compare with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProPhoto_RGB_color_space#ProPhoto_RGB_(ROMM_RGB)_Encoding_Primaries this exiftool -v output:\n\n| 1)  RedMatrixColumn \u003d 0.79767 0.28804 0\n| 2)  GreenMatrixColumn \u003d 0.13519 0.71188 0\n| 3)  BlueMatrixColumn \u003d 0.03134 9e-05 0.82491\n| 7)  MediaWhitePoint \u003d 0.9642 1 0.82491\n\nSo whatever fix you applied (again what it was?), it is incorrect IMHO.\nSomething of those maybe:\nhttps://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+log/refs/heads/master/packages/SystemUI/src/com/android/systemui/glwallpaper/ImageProcessHelper.java",
