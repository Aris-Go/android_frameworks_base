It aligns with our general approach of starting with the lightest/simplest thing, and expanding from there.  And it removes this uncertainty.\n\nThis will limit the amount of devices from which we can gather insight, but it\u0027s probably good enough.  brufino@ - I\u0027m curious as to your thoughts?",

For the avoidance of doubt, could you also verify locally with a test app that Slog.wtf doesn\u0027t throw @mattgilbride@google.com? Can we move back to Slog.wtf if the concern here is the throwing aspect?",
