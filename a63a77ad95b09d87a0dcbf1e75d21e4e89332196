      "message": "I\u0027m inclined to say no. That would expose us to corner cases in which we compute unClearedSize() on every allocation. As it stands, it\u0027s very likely we\u0027ll check again before we allocate another 3000 entries.\n\nI thought about just cutting WARN_INCREMENT in half, and I would still be fine with that. We could also do something more complicated here, and decrement by some value less than WARN_INCREMENT. I\u0027m OK with that, too, but I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s worth the added complexity.\n\nI\u0027d like to preserve the property that (in the absence of a leak) the overhead here always goes to zero as we run longer.",
