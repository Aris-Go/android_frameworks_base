If this becomes an issue then one workaround could be to add a flag to R8 to not emit any empty classes (or add an empty class_data to each class_def). We could also consider removing only the parts of the profile that give rise to the error, but it is unclear how stable this would be.",

      "message": "Hey, it would be quite important to have the baseline profile and I was going to update it according to the Android 15 updates. Removing it completely isn\u0027t ideal since we use Compose and baseline profile will improve the startup time overheads known to be introduced by compose.\n\n1. For android 14 (this change), would you be able to only remove the lines that rise the error as you suggested?\n2. For android 15, if I update the baseline profile with paths that are all recognizable, I won\u0027t run into this issue right?",

The problem with doing this is that it is not stable: Any change to the source code of CredentialManager may reintroduce the problem and cause postsubmit failures.\n\n\u003e For android 15, if I update the baseline profile with paths that are all recognizable, I won\u0027t run into this issue right?\n\nYou will still run into the bug on Android 15 unless: (1) b/335418838 is fixed in the build system, or (2) the profman prebuilts are updated to contain the fix from aosp/3047152.",
