I would update the method description to say something along the lines of \n\n\"Returns {@link BluetoothStatusCodes#SUCCESS} if LE Connected Isochronous Stream Central feature is supported or an error code\"\n\nThen, we can update the @return tag to say \"@return whether the chipset supports the LE Connected Isochronous Stream Central feature\".\n\nWe can repeat this for the other method in this CL as well.",
