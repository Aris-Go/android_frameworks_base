(I\u0027d still prefer we just added a \"module_name\" field to test_mapping and not do `test_module_config`.)\n\nThis originally was intended to only be used with TEST_MAPPING presubmit.\nIn gcl, you would just run the base.\n\nAlso, FYI, FrameworksServicesTests has several dirs/packages with the same suffix but different parts of the tree.  But it is the biggest one out there.",
