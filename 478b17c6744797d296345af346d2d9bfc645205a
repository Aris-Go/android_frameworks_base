It feels like that\u0027s really what we\u0027re getting at here: we\u0027re letting the OEM communicate a value that will match the specs that the user sees on their retail packaging.",

      "message": "I think that when OEMs talk about DDR size, they mostly refer to the RAM size. In the new SoCs, it is becoming more common that the RAM memory is shared between several software components. For example, the new Google and Intel Network card, has 16 ARM Neoverse cores and a Management module. These 2 hardware blocks share the DDR memory and the 2 Linux running there see different memory sizes.\n\nhttps://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/network-io/infrastructure-processing-units/asic/es2000asic.html\n\nIt is also common that the phones share the DDR memory between Linux and the TEE OS. https://source.android.com/docs/security/trusty\n\nIn my opinion, ddr_size or physical_ram_size would be a more accurate and hardware oriented term.\n\nLet me know if that sounds reasonable.",

      "message": "Hm, I understand the case you\u0027re making for those names, but there\u0027s still a risk that they\u0027ll be misinterpreted again at some point in the future.\n\nIf I zoom out, the problem it feels like you\u0027re trying to solve is that apps are trying to show a number that will match what the user saw at the point-of-sale retail packaging.  (That is, we\u0027re not solving a hardware-oriented problem, but instead a marketing-oriented problem.)\n\nThat\u0027s why I suggested naming like `marketingMem` which matches what the marketing team expects their device to claim.  Other names in this vein would be `advertisedMem`.",
