      "message": "I\u0027m sorry I gave you the comment on the wrong method but... this is going to crash, or at least return a different result than before. getNetworkCapabilitiesInternal can definitely return null. I only meant remove the null check in front of maybeSanitize because now maybeSanitize was handling null gracefully.\n\nYou had :\n\n  NetworkCapabilities maybeSanitize(@NonNull NetworkCapabilities nc) { ... }\n  ...\n  return nc \u003d\u003d null ? null: maybeSanitize(nc);\n  ...\n  nc2 \u003d nc \u003d\u003d null ? null : maybeSanitize(nc);\n  ...\n  netcap2 \u003d netcap \u003d\u003d null ? null : maybeSanitize(netcap);\n\nI wanted to avoid code duplication by saying just :\n\n  NetworkCapabilities maybeSanitize(@Nullable NetworkCapabilities nc) { if (nc \u003d\u003d null) return null; ... }\n  ...\n  return maybeSanitize(nc);\n  ...\n  nc2 \u003d maybeSanitize(nc);\n  ...\n  netcap2 \u003d maybeSanitize(netcap);\n\nI didn\u0027t want to you change networkCapabilitiesRestrictedForCallerPermissions.",
