      "message": "Thanks for reporting the issue and providing a patch to fix it.\n\nIt\u0027s likely that this will be overlooked in the future. Additionally, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s necessary to guard the profile owner details with the `ActivityManagerService` lock. Could you instead update `ActivityManagerService.setProfileOwnerUid()` and `ActivityManagerService.isProfileOwner()` to use `mProfileOwnerUids` as the lock ()? While you are making changes to that, if you could also update `ActivityManagerService.setCompanionAppUids()` and `ActivityManagerService.isAssociatedCompanionApp()` to use `mCompanionAppUidsMap` as the lock, that\u0027d be great.",
