Because Android pre-warms the camera app via the \"INTENT_ACTION_STILL_IMAGE_CAMERA_GESTURE\" intent in the pinner service, we would have to amend that one as well.\n\n```\n// services/core/java/com/android/server/PinnerService.java\n\n    private ApplicationInfo getCameraInfo(int userHandle) {\n        Intent cameraIntent \u003d new Intent(MediaStore.INTENT_ACTION_STILL_IMAGE_CAMERA);\n        ApplicationInfo info \u003d getApplicationInfoForIntent(cameraIntent, userHandle,\n            false /* defaultToSystemApp */);\n```",
