I realize that there is likely a line length formatting issue, but I haven\u0027t contributed to AOSP before and I\u0027m not really sure how to run the formatter from the online git source editor. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to clean this up and get it submitted or if there are other places I also need to change.",
