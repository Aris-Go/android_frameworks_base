      "message": "Thanks for doing this! Once this is approved, you may want to cherry-pick the change into sc-v2-dev -- otherwise, the fix probably won\u0027t go live until we start publishing Android T docs next year. (I can give Dr. No approval for a docs-only change.) But for such a small fix, I think it\u0027s okay to just leave the change in master and let it go live in a few months.",
