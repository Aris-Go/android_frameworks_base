      "message": "Some small grammar/spelling issues here, perhaps:\n\nSome carriers using ACS (auto configuration server) may send a carrier-specific pre-provisioning configuration XML if the user has not been provisioned for RCS services yet. When this provisioning XML is received, the framework will move into a \"not provisioned\" state for RCS. In order for provisioning to proceed, the application must parse this configuration XML and perform the carrier specific opt-in flow for RCS services. if the user accepts, {@link #triggerAutoConfiguration} must be called in order for the device to move out of this state and try to fetch the RCS provisioning information.\n\nCan you update ImsConfigImplBase as well?",
