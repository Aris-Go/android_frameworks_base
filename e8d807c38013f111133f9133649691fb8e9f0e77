      "message": "For testing purposes, I think it would be great if this class could be extended and mocked. Currently it cannot, because the one single constructor is hidden and it also takes a parameter of a hidden type. \nWould it be possible to move the implementation into a sub-class and make this one an abstract super-class? Alternatively if a public default constructor was added, but that seems less clean.\n\nIf this was done, test code could mock the hardware easier by implementing a sub-class of it.",
