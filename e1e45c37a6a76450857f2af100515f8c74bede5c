Feel to reject and I\u0027ll delete this CL if you expect the linked bug will be fixed in a different way soon (or if there\u0027s a better way to fix this, as I don\u0027t actually have the AOSP codebase downloaded).\n\nIf the underlying bug won\u0027t be fixed soon, I think this can be a quicker way to reduce log spam.\n\nThanks!",
