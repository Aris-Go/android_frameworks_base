I notice the same thing with the VPNs.\n\nIs providerId not relevant/necessary in the context of networks where the lifecycle of the network is not request-managed? Perhaps a comment on that would be helpful (The NetworkProvider#ID_NONE javadoc only discusses usage in NetworkProvider and NetworkRequest classes, but not NetworkAgents)",
