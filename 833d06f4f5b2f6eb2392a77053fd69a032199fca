      "message": "Given that this field is in NetworkCapabilities, presumably it can be set both on networks and in NetworkRequests, such that every Network, and every NetworkRequest, have either zero or one subscription group. But what does this mean, given that a group is just a list of subIds? Isn\u0027t it the case that a network has zero or one subId, just like it has zero or one subscriberId?\n\nThe docs at:\n\nhttps://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/SubscriptionManager#createSubscriptionGroup(java.util.List%3Cjava.lang.Integer%3E)\n\nsays that a subscription group is a group of subIds. It says that subIds can be added and removed from a group. But, what if two subscription groups have some or all subIds in common? For example, consider:\n\n1. Subscription group 1 exists with subIds 1, 3, 5\n2. NetworkRequest A is filed for group 1\n3. Network Z exists with subIds 1, 3, 5. A matches.\n4. Subscription group 2 created with subIds 1, 3, 5.\n\nAt that point, what happens? Should network Z change subscriber group from 1 to 2? Even if it does, will NetworkRequest A no longer match network Z? But why should it no longer match network Z, given that the subIds in the group are the same subIds in the network?",
