The previous definition assumed only numbers and possibly a leading +.  \n\nSee the following API guidelines: go/android-api-guidelines#behavior\n\nUnfortunately carrier config keys can\u0027t really use target SDK or the compat lib. \n\nYou\u0027d be best to define a new key with the new semantics.\n\nAlso, where is this used?  I don\u0027t see this consumed in the platform anywhere, so it looks like this is probably not something that should even be an API.",
