This creates complicate scenario for the case that user disables location while receiving cell identity A, but enables location while receiving cell identity B.

The purpose of this change is for apps that do have location permission, but do not actually need location related information, to access non-location information without triggering the hit in privacy hub. But in this case, you are actually accessing cell id, which is considering location related information. Isn\u0027t that reasonable to show that in the privacy hub? Sorry if I missed anything here.",
