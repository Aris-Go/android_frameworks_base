I wonder if our app is waiting on something else? Some other dependency?\n2. Are apps not even able to be ready this early in boot?\n3. Is there some way to mark our app as \"early boot\" or something to ensure it starts earlier?\n\n\nWorst case, we fall back to boot receiver. That\u0027s certainly better than waiting for the first user to login.",
