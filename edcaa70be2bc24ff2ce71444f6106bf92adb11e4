As far as we know at this point, this is a bug in the telephony API.\n\nThis change was built to save time in case we determine the reason why it\u0027s right to report something but to log something else. I don\u0027t think we\u0027ve seen thisÂ ; we have arguments for why 4G is right, we have arguments for why 5G is right, but we don\u0027t have a single reason to think than any of them applies to the logging code but not to telephony.\n",
