      "message": "Any reason you don\u0027t simply have TestNetworkService call registerNetworkProvider(mNetworkProvider) and use the real ID managed by ConnectivityService? Seems like a cleaner use of the existing APIs, which might help use move to mainline.\n\nIf there\u0027s a startup ordering issue, then maybe factor the registerNetworkProvider call out to a method that is called every time registerTestNetworkAgent is called? When that call is made, then either we have a ConnectivityManager, or the call will fail, so it should be simple to call a method that does something like:\n\n    private void maybeRegisterNetworkProvider() {\n        synchronized (mBinderLock) {  // or any lock, really\n            if (mNetworkProvider.getProviderId() \u003d\u003d NetworkProvider.ID_NONE) {\n                final ConnectivityManager cm \u003d mContext.getSystemService(...);\n                cm.registerNetworkProvider(mNetworkProvider);\n            }\n        }\n    }",
