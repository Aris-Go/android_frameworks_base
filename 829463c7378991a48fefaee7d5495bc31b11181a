      "message": "I appreciate your efforts to clean this up, but I don\u0027t think we can promote these permissions to public APIs without the detailed advice of various teams represented.\n\nInstead, I think the signature generation code should quietly drop permissions that aren\u0027t part of the given API surface being generated.\n\nAs a specific example of why I think this is the right approach, consider the APIs protected by READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE; many of them can legitimately be called by apps when they hold \"carrier privileges\" as part of the public API; the @RequiresPermission only actually applies when someone is using the API via its exposure in @SystemApi.\n\nI believe we do something similar when generated the @IntDef docs for constants; we only emit docs relevant for the API surface being generated.",
