      "message": "Pushed a new revision that saves the state \"mCameraLongPressMsgSent\" so that the MSG is only sent once per key down. Looks a bit ugly, and the back button behaviour doesn\u0027t care about multiple messages being sent as well, as they\u0027re cleared at the end of the timeout anyway.\nYour call.\n\nWe\u0027ve chosen long press mainly because it matches the behaviour that OEMs have chosen for their proprietary solution.\nOnce you launch on regular press or even on FOCUS (for two-stage shutters), you might have lots of accidental triggers.",

      "message": "I thought about this some more. Could you please describe this button a bit more? Is this just a dedicated camera HW button?\nIf screen is off, don\u0027t we want to launch camera as quickly as possible? If so, I assume that we want to launch camera on the first DOWN event in that case?\n\nIf the camera app is already open, then maybe we want to pass this button to the camera app, so that the app can decide how to handle (maybe focus on down / take picture on up)?\n\n\nIf you could explain the UX a bit more, it would be much appreciated.\n\nAs for the handler, you can use hasMessages [1] to see if a message is already enqueued. You can also look at repeat count and make that the decision based on that (only enqueue if repeatCount \u003d 0), but we should first figure out what to do with this key first.\n\n[1] https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Handler#hasMessages(int)",
