      "message": "While I think it\u0027s good for test methods to have the \"throws\" clause and avoid having try { } catch (...) { fail() } constructs, I\u0027m not sure having utility methods declare \"throws\" is a net improvement. It forces other utilities using them to also declare the exception, so that adds a lot of \"throws ...\" to the code.\n\nIf you prefer this style that\u0027s fine by me, I\u0027m just personally not bothered by the current style.",

      "message": "I think you make a fair point. I think the main standpoint to remove this is that generally, all test methods tend to throw Exception anyway. It may be worth noting that in this case :\n• expectNoStartActivityIntent throwing has moved testCaptivePortalApp() from throws RemoteException to throw Exception\n• expectStartActivityIntent throwing has caused no changes in the code. For good reason : it\u0027s not used. Removed :)",
