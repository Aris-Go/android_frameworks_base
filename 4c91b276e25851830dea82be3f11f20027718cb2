      "message": "In on secondaryPointerUp we have this logic to determine the new pointerId: \nfinal int newPointerIndex \u003d pointerIndex \u003d\u003d 0 ? 1 : 0;\nWhich is also used in the normal scrollview.\nThis assumes \n1) that there are multiple pointers on in the touch event when the POINTER_UP occurs\n2) that the other pointers are still on the screen and can be queried.\n\nAdam:\nAre those 2 assumptions always true? Otherwise we might need protect against this in many other locations too.\n\nIf we do this check, we might also want to set the mActivePointerId to INVALID_POINTER and handle the ACTION_UP correctly, where the velocity of the current pointer is querried.",
