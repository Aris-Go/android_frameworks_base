      "message": "This is really generic and covers a large number of cases where operation fails, but there is no need to expose details of why that happens.\nIt includes:\n - failure to start safety timer\n - failure to encrypt the payload (i.e. error in keystore APIs)\n - failure to save to non-volatile memory.\n\nNone of these is relevant for the client: what matters is that the operation failed and so the unattended reboot was not prepared correctly.\nThe client will need to decide what to do (most likely abort the unattended reboot, but this is not something that Telephony API should dictate).",

Even if the idea is to give an example, the example is too specific, as it refers to the current underlying implementation (e.g. keystore) which might change in the future without impact on the API. I still think that we should avoid it.",
