      "message": "Yeah, because they\u0027re system API.\n\nI suppose you\u0027ll have to mark them as deprecated if there\u0027s no way to actively remove them from the SDK in this release.\n\nPerhaps one to ask API council about: deprecation isn\u0027t really applicable because it\u0027s not like the code that uses these is still around. At a minimum the comments should be updated to say something like \"Vestigial permission declaration. No longer used.\"\n\nThere may be other examples of \"dead\" permissions / manifest artifacts you can follow.\n\nIn theory, QUERY_TIME_ZONE_RULES looks generic enough that it could be reused in future for mainline module update status, but probably not worth worrying about unless you have plans to use it immediately.\n\nThe same kind of deprecation / docs updates should be made to comments associated with anything else that\u0027s left over in the System API surface.",
