      "message": "Good idea. I need to double check that that\u0027s feasible (actually, the way I have it now may not even work).\n\nWe still need to call this method from code the view compiler generates, but I think that might look like app code and not framework code. Also, if we eventually allow precompiled views to be built in to apps, then apps will need to be able to call this method directly.\n\nI\u0027ll investigate some more.",

If it is on-device generated, I consider that ok hidden API.\n\nI thought only reflection would cause a call to be blocked. I didn\u0027t think it mattered which code was making the call. You\u0027re going to be making direct calls to this code. Is my understanding correct?",
