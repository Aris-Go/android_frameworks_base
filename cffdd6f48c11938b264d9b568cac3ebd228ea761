Without well defined events, its hard to imagine when these will get triggered.",

If so, then yes... this would hold a reference to an old context which would be a leak, but I was of the impression that the only way the Context could be deleted is if the app shut down, which would also clean up this static reference. We keep a lot of global references to the Context (for instance, PhoneGlobals keeps a static instance which keeps a Context). This object is actually a reference to PhoneGlobals (which is a ContextWrapper extends Context).",
