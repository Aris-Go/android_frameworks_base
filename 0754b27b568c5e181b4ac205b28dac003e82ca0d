      "message": "What do you mean by \u0027regular infrastructure\u0027? The way that sysprop updates are propagated is through binder; for process that only have Java binder threads, they need to call back into native code to let libutils know that a prop has been updated, since libutils is the one keeping track of the change callbacks.\n\nRegular binder does something similar, but it catches it earlier (before it ends up in Java):\n\nhttps://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/core/jni/android_util_Binder.cpp#311\n\nThe rationale in context of the bug is that to be able to support tracing of HIDL HALs that run a server in Java, we need to be able to tell them a tracing prop has been updated. So, we send a regular SYSPROPS_TRANSACTION, and when our auto-generated code for HwBinder interfaces receives that, it calls SystemProperties.reportSyspropChanged(), which calls libutils, which in turn calls registered callbacks.",

The API is simply very strange for anyone who has worked with properties on a regular Java platform - why would I manually have to update properties that got changed somewhere else?",
