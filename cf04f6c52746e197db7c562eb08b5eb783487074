      "message": "So, I\u0027m a bit confused here.\nBefore this change, the activity is tracked by NMS, and the edge is triggered by the Netd unsolicited event onInterfaceClassActivityChanged.\nAfter this change, the activity is tracked by CS, and the edge is triggered by a change in the satisfier for the default internet request.\n\nWhy are these two equivalent ? Doesn\u0027t netd send activity notifications at other times, like when there is traffic ?",

      "message": "This patch is going to replace the calls to update network activity to BSS.\n\nThere were two ways to update the network activity previously from NMS to BSS.\n1. Netd unsolicited event onInterfaceClassActivityChanged(NMS.onInterfaceClassActivityChanged -\u003e NMS.notifyInterfaceClassActivity -\u003e BSS)\n2. Idle timer setup/removal(CS -\u003e NMS.addIdleTimer -\u003e NMS.notifyInterfaceClassActivity -\u003e BSS)\n\nI already replaced the second path with the design in BSS to listen to the network activity change in IT4.3. So BSS does not rely on NMS to notify event from netd now. \n\nThen this patch is going to replace path 2. I also update the commit message to include the messages. See if it helps.",
