    OEMs that wish to change the below settings must do so via a runtime resource overlay package
    and *NOT* by changing this file. This file is part of the tethering mainline module.
    The overlays must apply to the config_* values, not the default_* values. The default_*
    values are meant to be the default when no other configuration is specified.
