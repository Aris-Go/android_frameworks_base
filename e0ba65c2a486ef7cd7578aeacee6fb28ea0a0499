This is in StorageManager, so doesn\u0027t that already make it mostly clear that it is a \"Storage\" key (whatever that is).",

Or `createUserFbeKeys` maybe?  I had `createUserFbeKeys` originally, but Paul felt that it was slightly inconsistent with the other methods.\n\nNote that in any case it is helpful to add the \"s\", given that this creates two keys, not one.",
