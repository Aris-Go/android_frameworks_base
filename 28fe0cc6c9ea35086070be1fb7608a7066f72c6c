      "message": "The reason I abandoned my patch in the first place is that Remi\u0027s changes broke the approach to supporting multi-sim here, but given that we are taking steps to make multi-SIM support a first-class feature in Q, that should be part of these changes. At the very least, could you file a bug targeted at Q and attach it to this TODO for a separate CL?",

My idea is to track them in the same bug. This comment is used to tell other reviewer that I understand multi-sim is missing here. Do you need me to update the comment and have another bug?",
