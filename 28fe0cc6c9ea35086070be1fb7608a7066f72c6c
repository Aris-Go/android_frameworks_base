E.g. if you do not enable WiFi, you will not receive broadcast for cell in my local testing. I think it\u0027s a previous defect. Design could not actually work w/o it.",

I understand that it does not make much sense to stop broadcasts about cellular latency based on a wifi setting, but who are the actual clients of this broadcast ? Maybe they only care about this information when the WiFi setting is set, so we can avoid sending unnecessary broadcasts",

My idea is to track them in the same bug. This comment is used to tell other reviewer that I understand multi-sim is missing here. Do you need me to update the comment and have another bug?",

It\u0027s nice so that if someone comes across the TODO they can get context, and likewise having the bug means that the TODO isn\u0027t forgotten. Once this part merges, you can update the bug to say \"MSIM fix still outstanding\" or something... just so it\u0027s clear to TPMs who are tracking this stuff what is still remaining.
