      "message": "Note to pod reviewing this change:\nThis API is present in its complete final shape in TM-DEV (it was introduced in a slightly different shape earlier in TM).\nThe NetworkStack module uses this API in its former deprecated-at-creation shape and need to be transitioned to the new shape so that the deprecated-at-creation code can be removed prior to API finalization.\nNetworkStack is AOSP-first and there are significant merge conflicts present which prevent a clean merge of the final API shape here, hence the stubs.  This work is done so that the NetworkStack module changes can be merged now (and automerge into tm-dev).\nThe POR is to cherry-pick the rest of the required changes to AOSP after that occurs.",
