      "message": "How about using a parcelable here (L2Info.aidl ?), is there other reasons not to use it apart from the fact that it\u0027s annoying to work with parcelables ?\n\nI think the IpMemoryStoreClient could still have a method called setL2KeyAndGroupHint, but it could put both in a parcel before sending it. This way if we change L2Info later, we don\u0027t need to maintain multiple overrides of setL2KeyAndGroupHint in IIpMemoryStore.aidl.\nLet me know what you think.",

      "message": "I think YAGNI. The L2Key is stored as a string in the database and all the memory store APIs rely on it being a string. The group hint, while also a string in the DB, is a lot less pervasive, but likewise, I can\u0027t see a world where we would want to change it transparently. If we ever want to change it, we almost certainly will want to deprecate the old column.",
