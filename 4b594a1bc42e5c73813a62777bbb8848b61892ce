      "message": "How about using a parcelable here (L2Info.aidl ?), is there other reasons not to use it apart from the fact that it\u0027s annoying to work with parcelables ?\n\nI think the IpMemoryStoreClient could still have a method called setL2KeyAndGroupHint, but it could put both in a parcel before sending it. This way if we change L2Info later, we don\u0027t need to maintain multiple overrides of setL2KeyAndGroupHint in IIpMemoryStore.aidl.\nLet me know what you think.",
