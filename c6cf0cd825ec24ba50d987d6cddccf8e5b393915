      "message": "Couple high level thoughts, but will defer the actual review to Santos and Fiona:\n\n1) This should probably be called `config_defaultDreamScreenBrightness`; dreams can still override the value on LayoutParams themselves.\n\n2) This is going to implicitly disable auto-brightness during dreams when set. We should probably make that clear given the rename to \"default\", or move the reading of the property into `DisplayPowerController` so this is only used if auto-brightness wouldn\u0027t be. DPC would then have to understand dreaming though.",
