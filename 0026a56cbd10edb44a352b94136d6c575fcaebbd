      "message": "Reading through the code, I think there is a possibility for this to block the CS thread. I think the sinister part here is that InetAddress.getByName() cannot be interrupted, and thus any new call to startLegacyVpn() can block. This may, in turn lead to the ConnectivityService thread being blocked via the following call trace:\n* CS.updateNetworkInfo() -\u003e\n* CS.notifyLockdownVpn() -\u003e\n* mLockdownTracker.onNetworkInfoChanged() -\u003e\n* LockdownVpnTracker.handleStateChangedLocked() (also holds an additional lock) -\u003e\n* mVpn.startLegacyVpnPrivileged()\n\nMy only thought with regards to making this safe (without moving this out of the synchronized(TAG) block, which would allow multiple LegacyVpnRunners to be active at the same time) would be to:\n\n- At the start of bringup, trigger an async DnsResolver query, storing result into an AtomicReference or similar\n- Wait here until it is done using checkInterruptAndDelay(); effectively polling\n\nThis ensures we never go into an uninterruptible state on this LegacyVpnRunner thread",
