      "message": "Yes, this is true. But this value is to identify and validate the SoC for GRF. This property alone is not helpful to find the required version for tests.\nAs shown https://docs.partner.android.com/gms/building/integrating/extending-os-upgrade-support-windows#new-system-properties, tests need more properties and find the minumum required version from those properties.\n\nTo make the check easier, ro.vedor.api_level is calculated on boot. (aosp/1856020). It will be more helpful to provide ro.vendor.api_level as a Build constant instead of ro.board.first_api_level.\nro.vedor.api_level is set by the init process and never changed after boot. This value can be changed when the device has OTA for vendor upgrade after the GRF period expires.",
