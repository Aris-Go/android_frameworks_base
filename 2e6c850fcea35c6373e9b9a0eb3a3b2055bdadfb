      "message": "Good catch. I believe the code will have issue with the secondary cutout side override as the array is treated as integer array in `DisplayCutout#getDisplayCutoutSideOverrides()`. Can you help to verify it can update the commit message to make it clear that this is a bug causing the function is not working as expected, instead of just an inconsistency which sounds like a style issue. Thank you.",

The logical display height was set to 0, causing divide by zero crashes. After this change, the secondary display initializes as expected.",
