      "message": "The correctness of this change based on whether judge meteredness from Capabilities instead of meteredIfaces list is ok or not.\nAs I know there are 3 possible considerations:\n 1. Wifi Meteredness Override: User can override meteredness from UI, through NPMS,\n    to WifiManager. And finally update the NC of Wifi. So this should be fine.\n 2. Races: It is possible that NC is updated but not yet propagated to NPMS.\n    Thus, the meteredIfaces will be out of sync in a short time. Where you\n    might get a different result when change NC and immediately query\n    isUidNetworkingBlocked(uid, iface). It looks fine to me since we get\n    the first hand information from NC.\n 3. NET_CAPABILITY_TEMPORARILY_NOT_METERED: not sure why, but NPMS doesn\u0027t look at\n    this capability. So AFAIK the behavior is sync between NC and meteredIfaces\n    for this.\n\nFrom 1~3 I think this is fine.\nBut not sure if Jean have other idea.",
