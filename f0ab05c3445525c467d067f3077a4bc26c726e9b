      "message": "Hello?! Anybody here? We can\u0027t let this bug be sitting there! If someone can give me a +2 for the Code Review (preferably from the Code Owners at least), that will make us proceed one step further. But if this commit gets a -2 in the Code Review, it\u0027s game over! Think about it.\n\nTARGET DATE\nI recommend that you review and approve this code within the next week or so to get it approved for the final Android 13 release in the next month or two (the build date is approximately three weeks before the date it was released; for example, the most recent build number for Android 13 is TPB4.220624.005, released on 7/13/22). There\u0027s no more time to waste!\n\nOnce again, no more -2\u0027s in Code Review or else it\u0027s game over! You need to seriously consider the fact that one of Android 13\u0027s key features is having per-app language preferences, and that Android TV does not currently support multiple locales. This bug fix, rather than internal bug fix b/232443481, is the only way to impress the TV OEMs and stop them from reimplementing region locking, particularly with Sony TVs.",

      "message": "Victor, this language issue is also present in Settings \u003e Accessibility \u003e Caption Preferences \u003e More Options \u003e Language on AOSP phones and tablets, and in Settings \u003e System \u003e Accessibility \u003e Captions \u003e Language on Google TV devices, including Pixel and Chromecast devices. Here\u0027s what we also know so far.\n\nLANGUAGE SETTINGS\n\u003e Android TV team is working to fix their Android TV language settings.\nI see this internal fix as reasonable for Google\u0027s own Android TV devices (Chromecast 4). In fact, Apple is working on multiple locale support for tvOS 16, according to the Xcode simulators.\n\nREGION SETTINGS\nAn alternative way to keep the normal region behavior is that the region setting should be split into multiple options.\n* System region: Select the region for the language chosen in the previous step.\n* Broadcast region: Select the broadcast region for the electronic program guide. For example, Sony TVs sold for the North American market have USA, Canada, Mexico, Belize, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico as available broadcast regions.\n* Zip/postal code: Enter the zip or postal code for the above broadcast region. This is used for TV program guide information from supported service providers (over the air/cable/satellite/streaming). The virtual keyboard for code entry can be alphanumerical or numerical, depending on the region.",

      "message": "I\u0027m sorry Kelvin but the above justification doesn\u0027t hold water.\n\nI\u0027ll honour the exciting dramatic tone of your note by adding a -1 this time rather than -2. This can be overridden if someone else in the Android team disagrees, however it really doesn\u0027t make sense. Let me try to explain the assumptions that are not right.\n\n\u003e I recommend that you review and approve this code within the next week or so to get it approved for the final Android 13 release in the next month or two (the build date is approximately three weeks before the date it was released; for example, the most recent build number for Android 13 is TPB4.220624.005, released on 7/13/22). There\u0027s no more time to waste!\n\nAndroid planning works on a very long schedule with many cycles of bug burndown and verification requiring us to branch off a release candidate some time before it is ready to commit to AOSP under the android13 tag. The release team has to cut the RC for each Android release months in advance of the actual launch date and then increasingly make small, safe changes that absolutely cannot miss the release.\n\nIf merged (which I don\u0027t think it should be), your change would be targeted to Android 14 (or some Android 13 quarterly release) at soonest. Nothing optional is going into Android 13 any more.\n\n\u003e Once again, no more -2\u0027s in Code Review or else it\u0027s game over! You need to seriously consider the fact that one of Android 13\u0027s key features is having per-app language preferences, and that Android TV does not currently support multiple locales. This bug fix, rather than internal bug fix b/232443481, is the only way to impress the TV OEMs and stop them from reimplementing region locking, particularly with Sony TVs.\n\nAndroid TV will release a Google TV setup app with the fix in the GMS bundle for TV, so it doesn\u0027t depend on the RC for AOSP and Pixel devices or even the API level since the same app is shared across most recent releases. As long as we can fix this by updating one of our apps to use the best practices, putting extra stuff in the framework doesn\u0027t make sense.\n\nHope that helps answer the question about release process, Victor.",
