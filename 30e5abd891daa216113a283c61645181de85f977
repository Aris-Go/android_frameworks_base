      "message": "Can I get a little more context on why we need a brand new tag?\n\nI\u0027m assuming the flow is that this new provided APK exposes these Activities for some other caller to start (system Settings?).\n\nIf that\u0027s the case, it seems like we can get away with a regular `activity` tag with a special `property` or `meta-data` tag which Settings can filter for to determine a preference category. Rather than using a new tag.\n\nNew tags are generally supposed to add entirely new component structures in the manifest that are not well supported by any other existing structure.",

      "message": "I agree, I originally just used the \u003cactivity\u003e tag in my manifest, but felt that adding a dedicated \u003cpreference-category\u003e tag would be more legible and clear.\nI\u0027m definitely open to going back to an \u003cactivity\u003e tag (although there\u0027s no actual Activity involved) with some special property, since adding a new Manifest tag just adds a lot of extra code (as evident in this upload)",
