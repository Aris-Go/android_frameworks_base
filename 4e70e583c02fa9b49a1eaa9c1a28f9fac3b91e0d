      "message": "Erm... my interpretation of the terminology here was: there is a set of engaged states and a set of disengaged states. The definition of these sets didn\u0027t change.\n\nBut we can also be in \"temporarily engaged\" if we switched to a disengaged state and are still within the 10min timeout. This timeout previously only applied to PAUSED, but now applies to all disengaged states. As in, previously, PAUSED could either be \"temporarily engaged\" or \"disengaged\" already. And I guess the previous Javadoc was a bit misleading because it seems to claim that PAUSED is always \"temporarily engaged\". Does that make sense?",

      "message": "Yeah my confusion is around the javadoc about `PAUSED` in the below `TEMP_USER_ENGAGED_TIMEOUT_MS`, but I see your point.\n\nOptional: Then would it be better to rephrase this sentence to \"...has recently switched to one of the user-disengaged playback states\", and it\u0027s also clearer to list these playback states explicitly. Or, maybe use `active / inactive` (https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/session/PlaybackState#isActive()) instead of `user-engaged` / `user-disengaged`?\n\nThus, the mapping between playback state to user engagement state seems to be less confusing:\n\n* active playback states -\u003e USER_PERMANENTLY_ENGAGED;\n* inactive playback states within timeout -\u003e USER_TEMPORARILY_ENGAGED;\n* inactive playback states after timeout -\u003e USER_DISENGAGED.",
