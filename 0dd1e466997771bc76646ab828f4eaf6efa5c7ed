      "message": "We chose \"Encrypted\", as that is what we require of this link. When using this function, the socket is guaranteed to be encrypted. However we can never ensure that the created link key will be unauthenticated since it is dependent on the authentication requirements and I/O capabilities of the remote device, in case the remote device supports SSP, or if a 16 digits/bytes long PIN code is used for pairing, in case the remote does not support SSP.\n\nIf we should mention authentication of link key in function name \"listenUsingNotRequiringAuthenticatedLinkKeyRfcommOn()\" could be used. But is maybe too long?\n\nPlease tell us what you think?\n\nWe will upload an service record variant too.",
