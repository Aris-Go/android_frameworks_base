      "message": "I actually don\u0027t think changing the method of getDeviceStateInfo is the best approach. We would be providing the clients that are asking for device state info, false information about the device state would be sent as those values haven\u0027t been committed to the system.\n\nIn ag/20514286 we changed to basically not report a state unless we had conditions where we matched a state value. Previously we grabbed the first state and that would be the one we send if nothing matched.\n\nMaybe we should modify the change in ag/20514286 to report the last reported state if we get invalid sensor values, and if the last reported state is also invalid than we grab the first one and send it.",
