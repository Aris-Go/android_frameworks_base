      "message": "It took me a couple seconds to parse the cheeky if/else-if combined with the fallthrough logic.\n\nOne simple change would be to reorder the 2 else-ifs to put the non-breaking ones at the end and then add a comment that the lack of a \"break\" in that case is intentional (even though your comment does say that we\u0027re going to attempt a transition to connecting... knowing that we should skip the retry timeout and then execute the Session Lost code is really reaching).\n\nIn general, unless there\u0027s a meaningful amount of code savings and the actual messages are related-enough, I\u0027d like to discourage the pattern of cheeky fallthroughs and if/breaks. It\u0027s very easy for someone else to come along and screw this up in a way that isn\u0027t obvious. Once in a while it\u0027s the right decision, but usually it a foot gun for the next programmer.",
