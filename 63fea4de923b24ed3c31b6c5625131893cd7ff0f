      "message": "Jean and I were chatting about this today and we were thinking we could move this part of the CL (literally, just these 5 lines where you move the place where we call mPermissionMonitor.startMonitoring) to a separate commit. The rationale is:\n\n- This doesn\u0027t really have security implications, it just makes things more reliable.\n- It\u0027s not easy to predict the implications of making this change on previous Android releases (this code has been there since L).\n\nThoughts?",
