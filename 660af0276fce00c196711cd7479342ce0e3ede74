      "message": "Hi Anton,\n\nCan you help suggest some code owners that can help me review my proposed changes to the core/res/res folders in platform/frameworks/base?\n\nTLDR: Renaming language+country resources to just language was the wrong thing to do (see the unexpected change from January 2017 at https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/b84a505b62d3d8d52f272e64a1a7f998aa69b8a7), which removed more than 30 languages from the Android UI language settings and the caption language settings and impacted many AOSP devices (including Google\u0027s own Nexus/ Pixel devices) running Android 8.0 and up. To fix this problem, we decided to add back the language+country resources alongside the original language resources and add the donottranslate-maps.xml file in each of the language+country folders that should not have been removed in the first place.\n\nOVERVIEW\nRoozbeh Pournader, an expert on Unicode text encoding, made this change on 1/10/2017, to simplify the localization resources. It\u0027s because nearly every aspect of Android uses the new locale picker (select language, then country/region). However, not all language elements use the new locale picker. This includes the Android TV UI language and the captions language on AOSP devices.\n\nPROVING THAT IT IS WIDESPREAD\nTo be honest with you, we would have started working on this patch as soon as we discovered this bug, in case Google releases a successor to the Nexus Player. However, the latter didn\u0027t happen until 2020, when Google released the Chromecast with Google TV (which we call the Chromecast 4).\n\nHere are the devices that have this localization bug, just to name a few.\n\n* Android Emulators having an API level of 26 or later (does not apply to Automotive Emulators)\n* Any Nexus/Pixel device sold in 2015 and later\n* Chromecast 4\n* Nexus Player\n* Xiaomi Mi Box 3 and Mi Box S\n* TiVo Stream 4K\n\nROOT CAUSE\nAfter a thorough inspection of the folder core/res/res/ in platform/frameworks/base/, this is what we found.\n1. The classic locale picker that was first introduced since the beginning of Android reads from the framework-res.apk to check for any locale resources.\n2. A locale is only valid if it is in the following formats: values-\u003clanguage\u003e-r\u003cREGION\u003e or values-b+\u003clanguage\u003e+\u003cScript\u003e+\u003cREGION\u003e\n3. If a folder shows a language, but not its country, it will not show the language in the list. Additionally, for the new locale picker in Android 7.0 and later, it will not show the region in the Suggested header, but instead in the All Regions header.\n\nPROPOSED FIX\nHere\u0027s what we did so far. We wanted to revert some changes made from the defective commit back to 2017, but we had to change course when Mihai told me that \"probably the best fix is not to move the strings.xml file to a folder with lang + region, but to ADD donottranslate-maps.xml to such a folder (and leave strings.xml in the lang folder, no region).\" We undid the folder revisions and added separate folders with language and region, each containing a file donottranslate-maps.xml depending on the country. The location data is provided by Google\u0027s Dataset Publishing Language at https://developers.google.com/public-data/docs/canonical/countries_csv, where we can see the geocoordinates for each country. We multiplied each of the latitude and longitude values by 1 million, since every existing donottranslate-maps.xml file uses integers as coordinates. For the zoom factor, I couldn\u0027t find a good number, so I left it at 4 for most countries (usually ranges from 2 to 7). The larger the country, the smaller the zoom factor should be.\n\nCURRENT IMPACT\nEven a single wrong move can negatively impact the localization framework. India is a developing country with 22 different languages, but only 14 of them are supported by Android phones and tablets (2 by Android TVs and the Chromecast 4). What if someone is deaf and their native language is one other than English or Hindi? This is the real reason why this is a critical bug fix in terms of accessibility services. In fact, there are approximately 63 million people who are suffering from Significant Auditory Impairment, which places the estimated prevalence at 6.3% in Indian population. We don\u0027t want these people continue to suffer!\n\nGOOGLE TV AROUND THE WORLD\nIn June 2022, according to https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction\u003dshowfull\u0026id\u003d1654071481, Google announced that for the European market, the new Chromecast 4 will be coming to the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Switzerland, and Austria. For the Asia Pacific market, it will be coming to Taiwan, New Zealand, South Korea, and India.\n\nFor the first 11 countries, the current setup allows for the following new languages to be released (most are already present in the Android TV 12 Emulators):\n\nEUROPE\n* Netherlands: Dutch\n* Belgium: French, Dutch\n* Denmark: Danish\n* Norway: Norwegian Bokm√•l\n* Sweden: Swedish\n* Finland: Finnish\n* Switzerland: German, French, Italian\n* Austria: German\n\nAPAC\n* Taiwan: Chinese (Traditional)\n* New Zealand: English (not in the ATV AVD)\n* South Korea: Korean\n* India: English, Hindi\n\nAccording to the article above, the Chromecast 4 \"was already sold by third-party retailers in these regions and all existing units will also get updated to support the new localized features,\" and that \"users will get an interface in their local language and deeper integration with local services.\" But when it comes to the last country (India), we immediately stopped right there. As I have mentioned earlier, India has so many different languages, such as English, Urdu, Nepali, Marathi, Hindi, Assamese, Bangla, Punjabi, Gujarati, Odia, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam. Without this important bug fix, only English and Hindi will be supported as local languages for the Google TV UI and the captions.\n\nOnce again, I am in need of some code owners to review my proposed additions to the code. Can you suggest some for me?\n\nThis is something that needs to be addressed urgently. Your prompt response would be greatly appreciated. We cannot put this one off the list.\n\nKelvin",
