      "message": "Explain why. Is it guaranteed that netdservice will be started after dnsresolverservice, because system/netd/server/main.cpp starts one before the other? If so, say so here... but also, is there a comment in that file explaining that we should not change the ordering in the future? Might want to add one.\n\nAlso, there\u0027s a reason why mNetdService is retrieved via mServices.getNetd() instead of by a static method (like NetdService.getInstance()): mServices can be mocked out and/or replaced in tests. You probably want to do the same here.\n\nBut... see below. I think this code isn\u0027t really needed anyway.",
