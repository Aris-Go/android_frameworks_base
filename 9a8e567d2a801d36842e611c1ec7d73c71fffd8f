      "message": "The problem was that first you would see bunch of messages reacting to this UNSOL (for example \"Radio Off @ init\"), then you will see RIL sending POWER request (seemingly for no reason) and only then you would see that you actually received UNSOL.\nThat\u0027s why it is better to log received message first, and only then react upon it (just like it is done for all other UNSOL messages).",

      "message": "Thanks for clarifying, I thought that was the case but wanted to make sure there was an \"real\" bug that I was missing.\n\nThere is one minor problem and that is switchToRadioState has a path that doesn\u0027t call setRadioState, but that is only called \"once\" so its probably safe to ignore for logging output. Although I\u0027m going to investigate a little further as the mInitialRadioStateChange might not be working as exactly as intended.",
