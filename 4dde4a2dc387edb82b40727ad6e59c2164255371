Given that we call the whole class a Motion _Event_, and in the Batching section we refer to \"all samples in a batched event\", it seems like \"event\" normally refers to the whole batch.\n\n```suggestion\n     * These values are relative to the state from the last sample, not accumulated, so developers\n     * should make sure to process this axis value for all batched historical sample.\n```\n\n(Similarly for `AXIS_RELATIVE_Y` below)",
