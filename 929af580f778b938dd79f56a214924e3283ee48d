There is a merge conflict when trying to apply this patch to Android U sources downstream because there were some changes that haven\u0027t yet been upstreamed to AOSP. So, what I\u0027m doing now is resolving these conflicts and doing a merge downstream first. After that, I will be able to submit bots CLs to AOSP. Thanks for your patience!",
