Otherwise, for space-less languages, really long character sequences (limited below to 48) will be suggested for addition in the context menu. The menu doesn\u0027t look very nice when such long words are suggested.",

      "message": "Difficult call really. For some languages the user will get super-long words which is not really usable, but not for all and not in every case. Disabling this in all cases might be too limiting. We dont expect that many users will discover the ability to add words if they need to do a selection first. We\u0027ll ask for advice from usability people internally though.",
