      "message": "It would have been nice to reuse packages/Tethering/jarjar-rules instead (not the test version)...\nBut the problem is the internal utils used by the test, and the zap rules below.\nIdeally they should be removed to avoid @hide api references ?\nAnother option would be to have some genrule to combine the base jarjar rules with a \"no rename\" file that lists the internal utils used by the test.\n\nNothing new in this change so no need to do it now, but this should be considered.",
