But these endpoints are in the EndpointList variable in Usb Gadget HAL. So for orderly work we need to\nmake variables \"fresh\" like in the case of property:sys.usb.configfs\u003d1.\nFor example, in UsbDeviceManager when property:sys.usb.configfs\u003d1 there is firstly setting all\nto \"none\" and then applying new configuration.",
