      "message": "That was also my first reflex. It doesn\u0027t work because getActiveRequest() will return a request from the old list. This code needs to set as the active request the one with the highest priority from the new list.\n\nInstead I could have called indexOf(getActiveRequest()) and use the same index in the new list. That would be faster, but would also implicitly depend on the list of new requests corresponding one-to-one with the list of passed requests, which is always true today but I don\u0027t think is part of the contract of this constructor.",
