      "message": "The fact that this synchronized block ends here means that other code in this function can execute concurrently with any function that calls assertSystemReady. Is that safe?\n\nOn the face of it seems incorrect registerPollAlarmLocked without holding the lock, but in practice that method is only called from systemReady so it doesn\u0027t seem to matter. That method should probably be renamed to something that doesn\u0027t contain the word Locked, or better yet, the if (mPollIntent !\u003d null) check should be removed and registering the alarm (which is the only thing registerPollAlarmLocked does) should be moved into systemReady directly.\n\nNot sure about registerGlobalAlert. That method seems to assume it\u0027s called from the handler thread, so calling it here from systemReady seems inadvisable. It\u0027s possible though very unlikely that this call to registerGlobalAlert could race with another copy of itself that is running on the handler thread.",

      "message": "registerPollAlarmLocked: after double checking, agreed it does not look like it needs to take the lock (which it didn\u0027t took anyway) so I removed \"Locked\" from the name.\n\nregisterGlobalAlert: it directly goes to INetworkManagerService and seems to be reentrant w.r.t the local state of NetworkStatsService. I imagine that INetworkService.setGlobalAlert itself is reentrant, so the only issue I can see with a race would be that the wrong setGlobalAlert call goes last and sets an incorrect threshold.",
