If it crashes when always-on VPN starts up immediately on boot, we can always go back to the method.",

      "message": "Ah you mean like, one thread returning non-null, and some other thread returning null later ? Yeah I guess this can happen in principle.\n\nChanged back to the final member, as I think it\u0027s much preferable if it\u0027s safe. I\u0027m just not too sure it\u0027s safe, and I\u0027m a bit worried of the impact – it would make devices occasionally boot twice, so it may be difficult to detect. But hopefully we\u0027ll learn about it if it happens.",
