      "message": "What you have here doesn\u0027t exactly violates the guidelines per se (https://g3doc.corp.google.com/company/teams/android-api-council/guidelines/index.md?cl\u003dhead#builder-method-naming) but it does multiply prefixes and does not match Kotlin property syntax. I think maybe we can avoid this with clever rewording, e.g.\n\n  setRoamingMatched/isRoamingMatched\n  setOpportunisticRequired/isOpportunisticRequired\n\nAnother observation is that while the match for roaming is permissive, the match for opportunistic is restrictive, which feels kind of inconsistent. The simplest solution is probably to say matchNonOpportunistic() or matchesMacro(). If you\u0027re willing to take the extra maintenance/development/testing work, you could have constants and say setRoamingMatch(int) and setOpportunisticMatch(int), and have ROAMING_YES, ROAMING_NO and ROAMING_ANY, and OPPORTUNISTIC_YES/NO/ANY.",
