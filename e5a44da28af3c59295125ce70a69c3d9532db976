      "message": "I don\u0027t fully understand the code, but the last step, MOBILE_POWER / mobilePps, seems to already be \"per second\" since both MOBILE_POWER and mobilePps are, so your change seems to be valid.\n\nHowever, here, mobileData is # of packets, not # of bytes.  So \"mobilePps\" is not actually \"per second\" but \"per millisecond\" in this case...?\n\n@Adam please advise. :)",

      "message": "Hi Makoto,  I think \"mobilePps\" represents  packets per second. \nwhen mobileData \u003d\u003d 0 or radioDataUptimeMs \u003d\u003d0, the result is packets/second;\notherwise,  it seems packets/millisecond, so should change to packets/second again. \n\nso I think need change radioDataUptimeMs to  radioDataUptimeSecond, do not divide by 1000. I will update this patch again. thanks",
