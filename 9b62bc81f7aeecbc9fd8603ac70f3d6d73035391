      "message": "Is it possible to rewrite these rules so that they zap everything unless it is in the android.test.mock.** package?\n\nI think that would be more robust as it would prevent classes from accidentally slipping through to the implementation if someone added a mock of a class in a different package that requires those sources to be included in the \"srcs\" property.",

If you add more source files in a new package without touching the jarjar rule file, the build will fail.",
