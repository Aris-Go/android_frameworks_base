      "message": "\"Capabilities that are accessible\"\n\nThat said, I wouldn\u0027t use the word \"accessible\" here, because this is not a security property, it only affects what is visible by default in NetworkCallbacks.\n\nFor the same reason, I think \"despite\" is not the right word either. As best I can understand, this should be:\n\n/**\n * Capabilities that are currently incompatible with VCN networks and thus require that the\n * NOT_VCN_MANAGED not be present in NetworkRequests.\n */\nprivate static final long VCN_UNSUPPORTED_CAPABILITIES \u003d \n        ...;\n\nEven if we do that rename, though, I don\u0027t think this is a good approach. Explicitly enumerating the capabilities here is brittle and is likely to break as soon as telephony adds a new network capability, which happens every now and again. I think we\u0027re better off enumerating the capabilities that the VCN *is* capable of, and having the opposite list.\n\nBy doing an intersection between this list and the list of capabilities, I think that basically just boils down to two: INTERNET and DUN.\n\nTherefore, I would suggest: why can\u0027t we live with something much simpler, i.e.:\n\n- If a request doesn\u0027t request INTERNET or DUN: no need to do anything.\n- If a request requests INTERNET or DUN, add the NOT_VCN_MANAGED bit.",
