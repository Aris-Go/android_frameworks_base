After this CL, this class won\u0027t be able to use anything in the request except for the ID. I don\u0027t know whether we will want to do that.\n\nWe obviously need a guard value here to distinguish \"lingering due to a request\" from \"lingering due to being nascent\". But technically speaking that does not require changing \"NetworkRequest request\" to \"int requestId\". We could also have a special guard value, such as a new NetworkRequest.NONE that has ID NO_REQUEST_ID. Or you could even use null.\n\nMaybe this class is simple enough that it will never need anything more than the ID. In which case, this CL is fine.",
