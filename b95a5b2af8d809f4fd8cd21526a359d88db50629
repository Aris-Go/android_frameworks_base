      "message": "Thanks Dianne,\nEd, lets just remove the key from the log for now - I am not convinced that it adds much practical value while debugging (to the info already being logged).\nYou can guard it by `(DEBUG)` if you\u0027d like.\n\nThe main reason this should happen is when there is bad usage from any client.\nWe have a report internally. We\u0027re investigating there to see if there is a bug somewhere in the call stack from the SMS app.",

(userdebug needs to be the same as user, except for some debugging tools you can optionally enable, because it is what we do our dogfooding against, which needs to behave the same as what we release, and provide the same privacy.)",
