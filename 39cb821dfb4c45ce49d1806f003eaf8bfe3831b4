      "message": "Hmm. If I\u0027m reading the AlarmManager documentation correctly, this will fire an alarm immediately. The alarm will trigger mPollReceiver, which will do:\n\n            // on background handler thread, and verified UPDATE_DEVICE_STATS\n            // permission above.\n            performPoll(FLAG_PERSIST_ALL);\n\n            // verify that we\u0027re watching global alert\n            registerGlobalAlert();\n\nThere\u0027s a chance that this registerGlobalAlert will race with the registerGlobalAlert at line 431. I think that\u0027s fine though. The two calls will end up calling INetd.bandwidthSetGlobalAlert (), and that holds a lock, so they will just run one after the other.\n\nDoes that match your reading of the code as well? Is there something else that could go wrong here? Also, to a large extent the current code already has this problem.",
