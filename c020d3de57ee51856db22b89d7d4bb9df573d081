      "message": "I think this is exactly as correct as the previous code, that is : not at all.\nHowever, the old code would update this score later and fix things up. That\u0027s no longer true.\n\n• If this request is the top REQUEST of a multilayer NRI this is correct\n• If this request has been satisfied, then for sure it\u0027s been sent\n• If this request hasn\u0027t been satisfied, then we sent 0 already\n\nThe only problematic case is where a multilayer NRI consists of RA and RB and RA is satisfied immediately, this will send a request for RB which might lead a factory to marshall a network to satisfy it, and if RA continues to be satisfied it will be torn down immediately.\n\nSo here again, let\u0027s stop as soon as we find a network with a satisfier, and hopefully my upcoming rework of sending requests to factories will remove all this code.\n\nWhat\u0027s your reading of :\n\n  for (final NetworkRequest req : nri.mRequests) {\n    sendUpdatedScoreToFactories(nri.request, null);\n      if (!req.isRequest()) continue;\n      final NetworkAgentInfo satisfier \u003d nri.getSatisfier();\n      sendUpdatedScoresToFactories(req, satisfier);\n      if (null !\u003d satisfier) break;\n    }\n  }\n\nThat will send updated scores for satisfied requests which the old code didn\u0027t do, but sendUpdatedScoresToFactories is idempotent so this should not be a problem (and may, in fact, fix bugs).",
