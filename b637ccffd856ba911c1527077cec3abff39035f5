      "message": "i suspect you are in a loop somewhere higher up the call stack. this isn\u0027t a native method; this is a helper function. so unless you can guarantee that it\u0027s never called within a loop, you need to clean up after yourself. an alternative here would be to have something like gMyClass \u003d NewGlobalRef(FindClass()) in your register_* function and just use gMyClass here. in that case, you can assume that the caller will clean up for you (probably with PushLocalFrame/PopLocalFrame around the call to your register_* function).",
