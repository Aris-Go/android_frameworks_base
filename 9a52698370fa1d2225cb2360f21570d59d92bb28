RULE_REJECT_ALL is filtered by MASK_METERED_NETWORKS, so never true\n 3. isNetworkMetered is always true from the input.\n 4. RULE_REJECT_METERED: Why we didn\u0027t check this condition? IIUC this is a bug.\n\nIf above is true, and we also put isUidNetworkingBlockedInternal to NetworkPolicyUtil, where we can access from CS, then we don\u0027t need this API.",
