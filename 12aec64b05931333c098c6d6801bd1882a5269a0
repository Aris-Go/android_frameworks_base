      "message": "This is a helper to deal with a multi-threaded fork. The problem is that the agent most likely runs in a non-single-threaded program. Then the set of operations you\u0027re allowed to do after fork (until exec) is *very* small. E.g., one should not allocate anything etc. That potentially precludes simple things like LOG (because there\u0027s no real guarantee how that\u0027s implemented).\n\nSo I moved the code into its own binary, so that it\u0027s a simple (double) fork-and-exec for the agent.\n\nDoes that make sense? Do you want me to add this blurb into the code?",
