      "message": "also, I just now realized I didn\u0027t mark this as \u0027@hide\u0027 since it\u0027s implicit. I really prefer using the system-current.txt file as the source of truth for what is in what API surface. I think b/71630695 is a much better solution for this thing (coupled with having \u0027in the SDK\u0027 not be the default but rather an attribute which I\u0027ve heard some people talk about). If I end up adding another patchset on this, I\u0027ll add it, but I\u0027d rather forget about this kind of thing for now and push for a more universal solution.",
