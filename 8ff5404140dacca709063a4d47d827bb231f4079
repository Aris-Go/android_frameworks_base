      "message": "I considered it, but because Blob is simply a wrapped byte[], I thought there was little point in making a wrapper for a wrapper. Nothing in there is final, the array is modifiable, anyone who has a ref to the Blob can touch the insides, but anyone who can see the insides can also touch the ref so...\n\nSo for the client view of this, I think the point is exactly the other way around : we prefer to avoid clients having to deal with *Parcelable classes. If this is the exception, I prefer it to be the exception to the stable AIDL files being called *Parcelable and for the client to have a uniform interface, rather than for all stable AIDL files to be consistent but have the client deal with the inconsistency.\n\nIf you feel strongly then maybe we should just make a wrapper for Blob, too.",
